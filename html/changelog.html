				<li class="rscadd">Necromorph acid can now damage clothing. Any acid that doesn't reach the skin will splash onto worn equipment instead, gradually eating through it.

				<li class="tweak">Buffed starting biomass.</li>

Both Chief Engineer, Director of Mining and Captain get a copy of the vintage rig</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the healthbar rig module, which displays the user's health in a meter along their spine. The healthbar is standard equipment in all rigs.</li>
