			<h2 class="date">01 May 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Nanako updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the exploder, a highly specialised Tier 1 suicide bombing necromorph. With art by Ketrai, audio by Jacob Danik</li>
				<li class="tweak">Enhanced slasher biomass cost reduced from 175 to 150</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Gas pipes are now immune to explosions, and AOE damage effects (Slam, tailstrike, charge, etc). No more gas leaks.</li>
				<li class="experiment">The Marker's activation time has been delayed. It will now activate somewhere in the region of 38 to 51 minutes into the round</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Necromorph corpses will now vanish when they have been fully reclaimed by the marker. But only when noone is looking....</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly buffed max health of Slasher from 70 to 75</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Possess no longer works on dead necromorphs</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new gamemode, Enemy Within. In this mode, the marker starts down on Aegis VII in a randomised location, but the unitologists have smuggled aboard a shard of it which they can use to create corruption growth and start an infestation.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new signal ability, Whisper, to communicate with people through subliminal messages.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Explosions are now smooth, flawless and lag-free, no matter how huge they are!</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Redesigned turret code and targeting functionality</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The bridge turret is now fully operational, and controlled from the nearby security office.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Necromorphs can now escape from bear traps</li>
				<li class="tweak">Beartraps and maws will now release their victim if the held leg is severed</li>

				<li class="tweak">Reduced the disturbed burn wound pain multiplier, from 0.5 to 0.3</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced metabolisation rate of necromorph acid, from 0.75 to 0.5, so it will deal damage more slowly</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed corruption being unable to grow down ladders</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a variety of bugs with necrovision not updating</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Security Rig to equipment lockers in security department.</li>

			<h2 class="date">11 April 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Nanako updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed necrochat randomly breaking.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Necromorph acid can now damage clothing. Any acid that doesn't reach the skin will splash onto worn equipment instead, gradually eating through it. As equipment takes damage, it lets more chemicals through. Items can also be damaged enough to be completely destroyed. This effect applies to all sources of acid. Puker, Spitter, Cysts</li>
				<li class="tweak">Biosuits and labcoats are now extremely resistant to acid.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Guns are now immune to acid, and won't melt.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tools now take damage from acid instead of just melting outright.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Acid patches on the ground now only cause damage above a certain visibility. No more taking damage from acid you can hardly see. Examining the patch will tell whether or not its safe to walk on.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed puker acid patches not drying up over time</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Acid pools can no longer be pulled around.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a massive new system for abilities that can be used by signals and markers, found in the Abilities tab. Abilities cost Psi Energy which is passively gained over time, and have an extremely broad range of functions. Many more abilities will be added in future.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nerfed cyst damage a bit. There will be a lot more of them around now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed starting biomass.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">Implemented the Vintage rig, with sprites by Mr Mann. The vintage rig is an extremely bulky antique suit that significantly slows the user, but provides a ton of protection and a few useful modules. Both Chief Engineer, Director of Mining and Captain get a copy of the vintage rig</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the healthbar rig module, which displays the user's health in a meter along their spine. The healthbar is standard equipment in all rigs.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The Marker, currently-posessed necromorphs, and signals now each have their own chat style in necrochat, prioritised in that order, so it's easier to tell who's speaking.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Admins can now read and mute necrochat</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Implemented the Puker, a brand new Tier 2 ranged necromorph. Puker is slow, but a flexible fighter and effective at all ranges</li>
				<li class="tweak">All necromorph acid attacks now slow the movespeed of their victims while coating the body. This currently applies to spitter, puker, and cysts</li>

				<li class="soundadd">Added firing audio for cyst corruption nodes.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Sawblades can no longer be worn on the ear</li>
